# Development template - Docker/WordPress

Creates a development environment for an existing WordPress site. This uses Docker to run website locally. It is designed to run an *existing* production WordPress site locally.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines 2 containers - 

* `wordpress` - for the website files.
* `db` - for the associated MySQL database.

The `wordpress` container has 2 volumes - 

1. The `site/wp-content` folder - Copy thw `wp-content` folder from the production site. It's used for all customisations outside of the core WordPress code. This includes the themes, plugins, uploads etc.

2. `init/prep.sh` - Disables plugins as defined in the `.env` file. It also makes the `wp-content` folder the same owner/group as the rest of the site.

**Note:** The `wp-config.php` file gets auto generated for this local WordPress instance.

The `db` container has 3 volumes - 

1. `database` - A folder for all of the MySQL files, this gets automatically generated by docker and can remain untouched for average usage.

2. `mysqldumps/backup.sql.gz` - This is a snapshot taken from the production instance via mysqldump, place the file in this location and it will get imported on the first run of the container automatically.

3. `init/migrate.sh` - A URL migration script, this updates the URL stored in the database, this also gets run automatically when the containers are spun up for the first time. 

## Usage

1. Create mysqldump from production site and place in `mysqldumps/backup.sql.gz`

2. Enter your configuration variables into `.env`.

    **Note**: You can disable certain plugins that are not needed for development, e.g. security or SEO plugins. 

3. Navigate to the project and run:

    `docker-compose up -d && docker-compose run wordpress prep.sh`

The website will then be available at `http://localhost`
